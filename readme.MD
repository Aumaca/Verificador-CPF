# Verificador de CPF - About

- I was searching about how to create desktop apps, and I find Electron.JS, after trying a little bit of Qt for Python and Swinger from Java.
- I learned a little bit about Inter Process Communication and stuff but I started with a simple project just to create something...

Node modules was removed due the size of Electron package, therefore, if you want to test, use `npm install electron` and then run the command `npm start`.
